# Admission_Portal
Admission Management System build using C language. 

## Description

- There are 2 different login facility for the Student and Administratives.
- Students enters his/her's data and this data will eventually be stored in a File.
- Students thus have the access to add-view-edit their own data.
- Admninstratives have the access to view-edit-remove any details of the Data Entered by Students.

## What could be done more?

- Adding Admission mechanism where the students are admitted to the specific degree based on their marks which all can be handled by Administrator alone
- Regularly notify the Student about the admission Process.
